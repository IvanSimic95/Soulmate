First of all, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to create a meaningful connection with you! As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything Iâ€™ve seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

, I could tell from the first moments that you are going to be blessed with a gorgeous baby boy, your own little miracle. I want you to know that in the next year, you are going to enjoy the beautiful journey of being pregnant and the Universe will work for you to perfectly balance your chakras and your energies. 

Even though you will face challenges with your emotional state during the pregnancy, your friends and family will be there to support you. You will have an easy delivery at 39 weeks and your healthy baby boy will bring enormous joy and happiness to everyone’s life. 

From the very first month of his life, your baby will be full of energy and vitality. Will eat well and give you the impression that is growing way too fast. He will feel the need to be constantly busy, to feel in the middle of the action. Although be aware that starting at about 6 months, your baby will develop a fear of strangers. He will be finally able to distinguish between his relatives and someone unfamiliar. Eventually, he/she will learn that can trust strangers, but it will take time and cannot be rushed. Support him/her and help feel comfortable with people who are unfamiliar by always remaining close by.

  Be careful that around 12 years old, your baby boy will face his first challenge. The search for the new, the desire to live and do great things, so characteristic of these years, also comes with challenges for you as a mother. However, these behavioral changes occur at the onset of puberty and during the transition to adolescence: increased emotionality and dissociation fluctuations, high-risk behaviors, the pursuit of satisfaction. He will be confused, agitated, and will likely make mistakes. Stick with him and take time and patience to understand his behavior because he will need your full support. 

   Fully grown, your baby is going to be beautiful and charming, graceful and sociable. His cooperative nature will make them excellent ambassadors and team leaders. Your baby will enjoy life, fun, and will have a very active social life, always surrounded by friends. In general, will revolve around art and is most likely to be the lead singer of a band, interacting with the audience, rather than a simple songwriter.

Being gifted with the blessing of Knowledge, your baby is going to make a great teacher, entrepreneur, real estate developer, creative director in advertising, marketing director, politician, or political consultant.

 It was such a pleasure doing your reading, my dear. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed connecting with your beautiful soul energy!

First of all, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to create a meaningful connection with you! As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything Iâ€™ve seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

Your soul mate will appreciate people's efforts to become better and more self-satisfied, and he will be glad to see that you are a hardworking woman who is thinking about her future and trying to find herself. With him, it will be easier for you to know yourself even more and to accept your dark sides. He will love you for what you are and make you look at yourself with different eyes, see how wonderful you really are and that you are a miracle by the mere fact that you exist.
Along with your soul mate, you will live a deep love different from the one you felt for other men, in the sense that you will first see in him a friend and a confidant to whom you will be able to open your heart, and your relationship will evolve into one of passionate love. He will give you the courage to want more from yourself and from life and not be afraid of challenges. Next to him you will feel stronger and more determined to fulfill your dreams and not let fear and insecurity keep you in place.
He will leave you the space you need to discover yourself, but at the same time he will tell you that he is with you whenever you need him and will support you unconditionally. He will know how to make you feel loved, appreciated, and strong enough to feel that nothing can stand in your way. He will kiss you and caress you as if it is the last day of his life when he will do this because he has come to live every day of his life so intensely and authentically over time. as if it were his last day. And from his perspective, this is the blessing of being mortal and not knowing how long you have to live. When you have this revelation, all your feelings change and everything seems more vivid and colorful, and life acquires a special intensity that you feel fully. The colors of your aura showed me that you will reunite with your soul mate in this lifetime in around 5-6 months from now.

 It was such a pleasure doing your reading, my dear. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed connecting with your beautiful soul energy!

First of all, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to create a meaningful connection with you! As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything I've seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

Your soul mate will like to express himself sincerely and show even the deepest feelings. He will see what is most valuable in you and will believe that you can become better regardless of the mistakes you have made throughout your life. He will believe that the most valuable lessons are learned from mistakes, so he is usually lenient and understanding.
He will like to pamper you and will often offer to prepare breakfast in his style and cheer you up from the first hours to make sure you start your day with a smile on your face. Because he is a man of attention to detail, he will take care to respect your tastes and preferences, and this is one of his ways in which he wants to show his respect for you.
Your soul mate will conquer you not only by words but also by deeds, proving to you every day that he loves and respects you. He will make sure that your life with him will be a pleasant one and that you will not miss anything. That is why he is a hardworking man who knows how to take care of his money and will invest it so that you can have a prosperous life. He knows how to keep his family life and career in balance, and your relationship will come first because it matters most to him to see you happy and fulfilled.
He has a good soul and if he needs to sacrifice himself for your good, he will do it and not feel it as an obligation, but rather a manifestation of the love he has for you.
He is the man who can turn even something trivial into something exciting and that is why you will not feel bored with him. He is creative and uses his imagination in everyday life and likes to bring a little something new into the things he does. The colors of your aura showed me that you will reunite with your soul mate in this lifetime in around 12 months from now.

First of all, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to create a meaningful connection with you! As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything I've seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

My dear, I sensed that you are so ready to receive the blessing of pregnancy and the universe is ready to offer it to you. In the next year and a half, you are going to experience the amazing feeling of becoming a mother, and I can tell after reaching the aura surrounding your baby, that he is going to be an exceptional baby boy. 

Regarding your pregnancy, you will not face any challenges, but you’ll have to stay away from overwhelming yourself with chores, or excessive physical activities, especially at the end of the second trimester and in the third trimester of pregnancy. Take time to practice meditation, yoga, Pilates, or any slow physical activity that might improve the way your body feels. Your due date will be on time, around 39 weeks and no difficulties will be shown. 

Your baby boy will be born healthy, and everyone will be amazed by his eyes. His beauty will be his first thing to attract people around him, but his uncommon personality traits will also act as a magnet for those who will be around your baby. He will be a creative and independent soul. He will love practicing his individuality and does not like to be tied down by rules and regulations. While he will not believe in invading anyone's space, he will expect the same from other people, even from you as his parent. 

He will start walking around 12-13 months old and the first words he’ll use will be to call you. From the very first years of his life, he will be recognized as an exceptional child who is driven. This trait will push him to achieve greatness in every aspect of his life, whether it's riding a bike for the first time, learning to tie his shoes, or aspiring to make the world a better place for all of us.

Being a driven child, your baby boy will be often conscientious, organized, focused, social, realistic, disciplined, and enterprising. He will be unafraid to break the rules when a certain situation calls for it. He will be the one who leads the rest of the people. He might look tiny for you, but a driven baby boy like yours will be a force to be reckoned with. It's likely he'll run a major company, country, or charity organization.

Be careful on his experiences regarding school around 14-15 years old. He will face a challenge in finding the power and the will to concentrate on school and not getting involved in bad friendships weird connections with older kids. He will seek support from you and you’ll have to patiently listen to him and his problems so you can find a solution together. 

 It was such a pleasure doing your reading, my dear. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed connecting with your beautiful soul energy!

As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything I've seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

Your soul mate will know when he first looks you in the eyes that you are the woman he wants to wake up next to every morning and whom he will sincerely love and take care of. Besides, his warm, deep gaze will make you fall in love like you never thought you would.
He is the man who will kiss you gently and tenderly while wishing you a great day. Although he will be busy and work hard for his dreams, he will do his best to stay with you and enjoy the pleasures of life with you as much as possible. You will have moments of passion with him, and the relationship between you will be marked by intensity and tenderness. The flame of passion between you will burn constantly, so the bond between you will last for many years.
It will be important for him to know that he will live his life wisely, so that in the end he will be satisfied and reconciled with what he has accomplished. He is a real man who expresses himself as he is and will inspire you to do the same. With him next to you you will feel a great freedom of expression and you will connect with your naturalness and your inner being and you will be much more satisfied and at peace with yourself. He will help you see that the world is not good or bad, but that it simply exists, but the labels of good and evil were rather created by people, and hence the judgments and criticisms of others.
 Your soul mate will make you give a new meaning to your life and will be with you when you go through various changes or challenges aimed at your personal, spiritual development. You will be able to communicate openly with him and you will be able to tell him what you have in mind because he will be there to tell you a good word and give you advice that will really help you. The colors of your aura showed me that you will reunite with your soul mate in this lifetime in around 7-9 months from now.

It will be important for him to know that he will live his life wisely, so that in the end he will be satisfied and reconciled with what he has accomplished. He is a real man who expresses himself as he is and will inspire you to do the same. With him next to you you will feel a great freedom of expression and you will connect with your naturalness and your inner being and you will be much more satisfied and at peace with yourself. He will help you see that the world is not good or bad, but that it simply exists, but the labels of good and evil were rather created by people, and hence the judgments and criticisms of others.
 Your soul mate will make you give a new meaning to your life and will be with you when you go through various changes or challenges aimed at your personal, spiritual development. You will be able to communicate openly with him and you will be able to tell him what you have in mind because he will be there to tell you a good word and give you advice that will really help you. The colors of your aura showed me that you will reunite with your soul mate in this lifetime in around 7-9 months from now.

 It was such a pleasure doing your reading, my dear. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed connecting with your beautiful soul energy!

First of all, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to create a meaningful connection with you! As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything I've seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

I’ve been focusing on your energies and after deep meditation, I can happily tell you that in the next year and a half you are going to receive from the universe the great blessing of being pregnant. You’ll give birth to a successful, healthy baby boy and your life will change forever. 

The pregnancy process will be smooth, without any critical changes or difficulties, but be aware that your body will face some changes so you will need to adjust your diet and your lifestyle. Your due date will be “on the clock”, in the last week of the third trimester and you’ll have all the emotional support needed coming from friends and family. 

Your baby boy will show amazing personality traits from the earliest months, and you’ll be amazed at how much things are going to change with having him around. He will most likely be a little stubborn baby, with high energy and intelligence levels, and he might not take no for an answer. He’ll rush into adulthood as he will take his first steps around 14 months and he will call you around the house around the same age. 

As he grows, if you will find him stuck while assembling LEGO blocks or solving a puzzle, you won’t witness them giving up so easily. On the other side, your baby boy will be a nature lover. Take him outdoors often. He will love to explore nature and just walk in the great outdoors. It will never be too early to introduce him to the park or the sandbox or just hold him in your backyard and show him the setting sun and the birds flying home.  

Around the age of 5, he will discover his passion for football and the amazing news are that he is going to be an excellent player. In the years to come, don’t be surprised if he’ll spend more time on the football field than home, but once you are going to cook his favorite food, you’ll conquer his heart and attention; he will be a sucker for your pasta. 

As he grows into his teenage years, your boy will become more focused on school and education. He sees himself as a famous doctor and he will work hard to get there. He will start spending more time studying and doing volunteering in hospitals and easily forget about the time spent playing football. Encourage him to pursue his goals and dreams because the universe has everything prepared so he can be the successful person he dreams to be. 

 It was such a pleasure doing your reading, my dear. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed connecting with your beautiful soul energy!

First of all, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to create a meaningful connection with you! As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything I've seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

My dear, you are so lucky because, in the next 2 years and a half, you’ll be blessed with a pregnancy and a beautiful, healthy baby boy that will change your life for good in ways you never thought it is possible. 

Pregnancy will be quite challenging for you, but there won’t be problems that you can’t handle. Be aware that in the last trimester you might need to take long bed rest and keep yourself away from physical exhaustion. The due date will be on time, and you’ll have plenty of emotional support. 

Your baby boy will always have a smile on his face and is most likely to make those cute gurgly sounds at anyone he will remotely like. Your baby will be enthusiastic and positive and is likely to receive tons of love in return. He will love attention and will merely direct you to praise him if you don’t, rather than throwing a tantrum. He will start walking and mumbling his first words around 14 months. 

As he’ll grow, he won’t be afraid to go his own way and think outside of the box. While these qualities could prove ideal for a future entrepreneur, at home, you may struggle with him constantly pushing the boundaries. Around 7 he’ll discover new habits and hobbies, and one of the most important will be drawing sketches, as he’ll use this talent in his adult life to grow a career. In his teenage period, he’ll grow up to be quite the perfectionist and may have a slightly shy side, but he’ll be forever faithful and affectionate to friends and family.

Being so perfectionist, diligent, and focused on his goals, your boy will grow up an independent man with a dream career in graphic design or architecture.

As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything I've seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

Dear, in the next year and a half you are going to experience the beautiful journey of pregnancy. The universe will offer you a smart, unique baby boy that will change your entire existence. 

During the 9 months of pregnancy, you’ll find it difficult to stay as active as before, but there will not be any complications. Your due date will be in the 39th week and you’ll have all the emotional support from friends and family. 

Your future baby boy will change the way you look at your life. From the very first weeks, he will bring light into your home, and you’ll notice how special his personality and character are. You’ll see his first words around 13 months and his first steps into the world will be around the same age. 

Your baby will crave independence very early on, so get used to hearing the words ‘I will do’ often. He will also love attention and will expect you to applaud him every time he will achieve a milestone. Not doing so will bring out his sensitive, fussy nature, so beware.

 He will be ambitious and motivated to be successful, which means you’ll probably spend less time forcing him to complete his homework and more time encouraging him to have some fun. As your baby grows, he’ll develop a passion for sports, and around 6 years old will be a great time for you to let him choose between soccer or basketball. He will have no problems with adjusting and making friends. 

Your baby boy will be quite attached to a father-like figure and often get inspired and motivated by this successful person with whom he has a special connection. As he will reach his teenage period, with a high potential of being rich and famous, your boy will grow up to be generous, kind, and a good judge of character. Once he’ll have an opinion about someone, he won’t end up changing his mind, so be prepared for some stubbornness. His courage and stubbornness will make him a successful lawyer or judge. 

 It was such a pleasure doing your reading, my dear. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed connecting with your beautiful soul energy!

As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything I've seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

My dear, I sensed that you are so ready to receive the blessing of pregnancy and the universe is ready to offer it to you. In the next year and a half, you are going to experience the amazing feeling of becoming a mother, and I can tell after reaching the aura surrounding your baby, that he is going to be an exceptional baby boy. 

Regarding your pregnancy, you will not face any challenges, but you’ll have to stay away from overwhelming yourself with chores, or excessive physical activities, especially at the end of the second trimester and in the third trimester of pregnancy. Take time to practice meditation, yoga, Pilates, or any slow physical activity that might improve the way your body feels. Your due date will be on time, around 39 weeks and no difficulties will be shown. 

Your baby boy will be born healthy, and everyone will be amazed by his eyes. His beauty will be his first thing to attract people around him, but his uncommon personality traits will also act as a magnet for those who will be around your baby. He will be a creative and independent soul. He will love practicing his individuality and does not like to be tied down by rules and regulations. While he will not believe in invading anyone's space, he will expect the same from other people, even from you as his parent. 

He will start walking around 12-13 months old and the first words he’ll use will be to call you. From the very first years of his life, he will be recognized as an exceptional child who is driven. This trait will push him to achieve greatness in every aspect of his life, whether it's riding a bike for the first time, learning to tie his shoes, or aspiring to make the world a better place for all of us.

Being a driven child, your baby boy will be often conscientious, organized, focused, social, realistic, disciplined, and enterprising. He will be unafraid to break the rules when a certain situation calls for it. He will be the one who leads the rest of the people. He might look tiny for you, but a driven baby boy like yours will be a force to be reckoned with. It's likely he'll run a major company, country, or charity organization.

Be careful on his experiences regarding school around 14-15 years old. He will face a challenge in finding the power and the will to concentrate on school and not getting involved in bad friendships weird connections with older kids. He will seek support from you and you’ll have to patiently listen to him and his problems so you can find a solution together. 

 It was such a pleasure doing your reading, my dear. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed connecting with your beautiful soul energy!

First of all, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to create a meaningful connection with you! As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything I've seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

Dear, your energies and your higher self are ready to embrace the gift of bearing a child into this world. Prepare yourself because in the next year and a half you are going to be blessed with a gorgeous, gifted baby boy. 

You won’t face any huge problems during your pregnancy but starting with the 5th month you might have mood swings and feel tearful or easily irritated all the time. Taking long walks and make a step back from overwhelming yourself with physical activities will help you reduce these imbalances. Your due date will be in the 39th week of pregnancy and birth will not suffer any straits. 

Your baby boy will be perfectly healthy, and his physical features will conquer every eye and heart around him. His beauty will be noticed from the very first days and it will be an asset in his adult life. He will rush into speaking his first words around 14 months, but his first straight steps will show up around 16 months. 

He is going to have a big personality. He will easily light up the room with his presence and impressive talents. He will love to perform once he will overcome his stage fright. Around the age of 7, you’ll notice that your baby boy will be an interesting combination of introvert and extrovert. He will love to socialize but enjoy his alone time just as much. He will know what he wants early on friends, food, toys, so you will need to slowly introduce him to a couple of varieties so he can expand his horizons. Be aware that around his teenage period, he will face up some challenges in creating friendships or finding his first love. He will seek your support and you’ll need to stick around when things get rough for him. 

He will be a very bolt and brainy pupil and student, and he’ll have a special connection with one of his professors as he will receive guidance in choosing his career path and becoming the person he wants to be. His hobbies will be quite different from other kids as he will enjoy crafting, woodworking, or other projects that involve his hands and special view over material things. He will take great interest in building things with his bare hands and will likely follow an architect or constructing engineer career after finishing college. 

 It was such a pleasure doing your reading, my dear. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed connecting with your beautiful soul energy!

First of all, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to create a meaningful connection with you! As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything Ive seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

My dear, you’ll receive great blessings from the universe and one of them will be a healthy pregnancy. In the upcoming two years, you’ll be giving birth to an exceptional baby boy with very distinctive gifts. 

A pregnancy journey, like any other blessing in your life, is not going to be an easy one, especially in the last weeks when anxiety and tiredness will overcome your body and mind. Your due date will be on your last week of pregnancy and the birth process will go smooth. 

Your baby boy will have an infectious smile and laughter. He’ll have a charismatic personality and will love making friends and exploring the world outside. Your baby will be kind-hearted and always fun to be around, but he can also be sensitive and emotional. He may also get bored quite fast and get antsy, but don’t give in to it. Instead, teach him to maintain consistency.

He’ll be tongue-tied until 13 months, but he’ll be mumbling his first words exactly when you are not expecting. He’ll take his first steps around the same age, and you’d better enjoy outdoor activities with him because he’ll have lots of hobbies. Around 5 he’ll learn to ride a bike and discover his passion for music. While he will stand out for his intelligence, your baby can become easily bored. After-school activities or some variety in his routine could be the perfect thing to keep him on task.

As he’ll step into his preteen years, your baby boy will show great interest in computers and science. He’ll be a nerdy kid, up to date with everything new regarding programming, software, and games. Being so skilled and tech-savvy he’ll raise interest in many prestigious schools and his adult life and career will focus on this. 

 It was such a pleasure doing your reading, my dear. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed connecting with your beautiful soul energy!

As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything Ive seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

I connected with the energies surrounding you and I am happy to tell you that the next two years are going to be an adventure for you - You’ll get pregnant and give birth to an amazing, gifted baby boy that will give your life meaning. 

Pregnancy is not an easy process, and although you’ll be facing hormonal imbalances and emotional disruptions, anxiety and depression will slowly fade away after giving birth. You’ll be having your baby in the 40th week and no complications will pop up. 

Your baby boy will be charismatic and will always put a smile on everyone’s face. He’ll conquer everyone’s heart with special physical aspects, as his eyes will be a unique asset. He’ll surprise you by mumbling his first words around 14 months and his first steps around the house will show around the same time. 

In his early years of life, your baby boy’s favorite toy is his imagination. Leave him alone, and he’ll be off to his dreamland, playing dress-up, and having a ball of a time by himself. He’ll be creative and emotional and often crave their own safe space. Don’t mistake his aloofness with the outside world for laziness, though, as he’ll be observant, ambitious, and believes in his creative talent enough to see it through. Teach your child to speak out what he’s thinking and come up with a way to deflect the monsters-under-the-bed fear while you’re at it. 

As he’ll grow, your baby will show not so much interest in outdoor activities, but he’ll definitely find hobbies inside. He’ll be passionate about crafting, drawing, and hand-made activities. He will also have a special connection with his aunt or a mother-like figure with whom he will engage in conversations; he’ll often seek advice from this person and will ask for help whenever he feels you will not support him enough. 

In his teenage years, your boy will show a huge interest in his career development, and he’ll focus a lot on his childhood passions. Don’t be surprised if he turns out to be a successful architect or construction engineer.

A pregnancy journey, like any other blessing in your life, is not going to be an easy one, especially in the last weeks when anxiety and tiredness will overcome your body and mind. Your due date will be on your last week of pregnancy and the birth process will go smooth. 

Your baby boy will have an infectious smile and laughter. He’ll have a charismatic personality and will love making friends and exploring the world outside. Your baby will be kind-hearted and always fun to be around, but he can also be sensitive and emotional. He may also get bored quite fast and get antsy, but don’t give in to it. Instead, teach him to maintain consistency.

He’ll be tongue-tied until 13 months, but he’ll be mumbling his first words exactly when you are not expecting. He’ll take his first steps around the same age, and you’d better enjoy outdoor activities with him because he’ll have lots of hobbies. Around 5 he’ll learn to ride a bike and discover his passion for music. While he will stand out for his intelligence, your baby can become easily bored. After-school activities or some variety in his routine could be the perfect thing to keep him on task.

As he’ll step into his preteen years, your baby boy will show great interest in computers and science. He’ll be a nerdy kid, up to date with everything new regarding programming, software, and games. Being so skilled and tech-savvy he’ll raise interest in many prestigious schools and his adult life and career will focus on this. 

 It was such a pleasure doing your reading, my dear. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed connecting with your beautiful soul energy!

First of all, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to create a meaningful connection with you! As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything Iâ€™ve seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

My dear, the Universe has so many blessings waiting for you and one of the greatest is a long-waited pregnancy that will appear in your life in the following two years. Since Ive been in a deep connection with the energies surrounding your future baby, I am happy to tell you that you will be blessed with a beautiful, healthy baby boy. 
Your pregnancy will be safe, and you will not encounter difficulties along the nine months. Emotionally speaking, you are going to have timeframes of apprehension, concern, and nervousness but the joy and happiness youll feel when giving birth will cover up all the pins and needles felt during your pregnancy. 
Your baby will show great personality traits, as he will be quite an energic baby, curious, and will have a strong sense of individuality. He will play alone in his crib and will prefer to stay away from crowded places. Just as you are curious about your baby and what theyre like, your baby wants to get to know you and bond with you. Dont worry about doing everything right and trying to be the perfect parent. Youll be good enough just by being yourself. Try to make time each day to sit and enjoy watching your baby when theyre awake.
Around 10-12 months he will begin to speak up his first words and embrace the challenge of the first steps. Starting from then, you need to observe your baby, try to understand his social preferences, and then play to his strengths. Give your baby boy as much time in groups as possible, arranging for playdates or time spent with an energetic babysitter.
Youll notice from the first years of his life that your baby boy tends to focus on practical activities. He will not be dreamy, nor have an artist personality. He tends to be pragmatic and well-anchored and generally has broad worldviews. He will not lose their optimism and always find the power to start over. Failures are seen as life lessons from which he will learn and is not discouraged when things do not go as planned. In these rare cases, he will look for alternative solutions and use their inventiveness. He will always find support in you, either emotional or just pieces of advice on how he needs to take care of things. 

 It was such a pleasure doing your reading, my dear. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed connecting with your beautiful soul energy!

First of all, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to create a meaningful connection with you! As we continue, please make yourself comfortable and feel wholeheartedly everything Iâ€™ve seen while connecting with your aura and energy. I hope that sharing this with you will kindle a light of joy in your heart, and let you know that beautiful things are on the way.

Ive been focusing on your energies and after deep meditation, I can happily tell you that in the next year and a half you are going to receive from the universe the great blessing of being pregnant. Youll give birth to a successful, healthy baby boy and your life will change forever. 
The pregnancy process will be smooth, without any critical changes or difficulties, but be aware that your body will face some changes so you will need to adjust your diet and your lifestyle. Your due date will be “on the clock”, in the last week of the third trimester and youll have all the emotional support needed coming from friends and family. 
Your baby boy will show amazing personality traits from the earliest months, and youll be amazed at how much things are going to change with having him around. He will most likely be a little stubborn baby, with high energy and intelligence levels, and he might not take no for an answer. Hell rush into adulthood as he will take his first steps around 14 months and he will call you around the house around the same age. 
As he grows, if you will find him stuck while assembling LEGO blocks or solving a puzzle, you wont witness them giving up so easily. On the other side, your baby boy will be a nature lover. Take him outdoors often. He will love to explore nature and just walk in the great outdoors. It will never be too early to introduce him to the park or the sandbox or just hold him in your backyard and show him the setting sun and the birds flying home.  
Around the age of 5, he will discover his passion for football and the amazing news are that he is going to be an excellent player. In the years to come, dont be surprised if hell spend more time on the football field than home, but once you are going to cook his favorite food, youll conquer his heart and attention; he will be a sucker for your pasta. 
As he grows into his teenage years, your boy will become more focused on school and education. He sees himself as a famous doctor and he will work hard to get there. He will start spending more time studying and doing volunteering in hospitals and easily forget about the time spent playing football. Encourage him to pursue his goals and dreams because the universe has everything prepared so he can be the successful person he dreams to be.

Dear, please expect wonderful news in the upcoming two years, as you are going to be blessed with the wonderful gift of pregnancy and youll give birth to a gifted, handsome baby boy. 
Even though your pregnancy will be stressful and difficult to bear with, especially starting with the 31st week, youll have no serious problems and delivery will go smoothly. Your due date will be during the 39th week and youll get plenty of support from your loved ones. 
Your baby boy will be the beauty of your family. His amazing physical features, especially his eyes, will conquer everyones heart and will be a great asset during his adulthood. With a big smile and a cute guggling, your baby boy will possess a uniquely affable, eager-to-please energy. This will be evident in your baby tike early, as you start to notice his curious eyes and easy giggle. He will love to be where the people are, so take them with you whenever you go outside. Hell rush to talk and walk, so expect him to do that around 14 months. 
As he grows, your baby will have lots of outdoor passions and hobbies, and the most remarkable ones, which will define him as an adult will be photography and drawing. Expect him to take your phone and just make hundreds of pictures of one single flower or bird he sees. Around 12 hell attend private photography classes and youll notice how quickly hell turn his passion into a real skill. He will focus on school, and youll notice that hell prefer to explore nature by himself instead of spending time with other kids of his age. 
He will create a special bond with a person interested in photography, whose passions are common with his. This person will be his guidance and will help him accomplish his dream. Hell attend University and work hard to have his own art gallery or shoot photos for celebrities.
